    this op randomly crops a subimage.  Given a user-provided set of input constraints,
    the crop window is resampled until it satisfies these constraints.
    If within 100 trials it is unable to find a valid crop, the original
    image is returned. Both input boxes and returned boxes are in normalized
    form (e.g., lie in the unit square [0, 1]).

    Arguments:
        image: a float tensor with shape [height, width, 3],
            with pixel values varying between [0, 1].
        boxes: a float tensor containing bounding boxes. It has shape
            [num_boxes, 4]. Boxes are in normalized form, meaning
            their coordinates vary between [0, 1].
            Each row is in the form of [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax].
        min_object_covered: the cropped image must cover at least this fraction of
            at least one of the input bounding boxes.
        aspect_ratio_range: allowed range for aspect ratio of cropped image.
        area_range: allowed range for area ratio between cropped image and the
            original image.
        overlap_thresh: minimum overlap thresh with new cropped
            image to keep the box.
